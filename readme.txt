This project is made by Manan Mittal under the guidance of Professor Souvik Chakraborty, IIT Delhi.

In this project, we made a classifier based on SVM to differentiate between different hand gestures.

To run the model you have to run "Final.py" file.
But before running make sure you have downloaded all the files that is included in this folder-
"datamaker.py", "dataset.zip", "hog_svm2.pkl", "train_svm.py", "Final.py", "test_svm.py","dataset.zip".


Also make sure that you have installed all the libraries required to run the code some of the libraries are listed below:-
OpenCv
Matplotlib
sklearn
joblib


For using our formed dataset extract "dataset.zip".
For making your own dataset:-
Run 'datamaker.py' and enter label for data you want to create database. Then show corresponding gesture in rectangle area 

For training the model:-
Run 'train_svm.py"

For testing the model:-
Run "test_svm.py"

For running real time gesture classifier:-
Run "Final.py"
